🛠️ Built With

HTML

CSS

Vanilla JavaScript

Canvas API

That’s it.

🚀 How It Works (Quick Overview)

You upload an image

The image is drawn onto a <canvas>

Filters are applied using canvasContext.filter

Sliders update filter values in real time

Presets just set multiple filter values at once

The final image can be downloaded directly from the canvas

Everything happens in the browser.

🎨 Presets

Presets are just predefined filter values.
Clicking one:

Updates the internal filter state

Syncs the slider UI

Re-renders the canvas

You can easily add your own presets by editing the presets object.
